Please find attached files with daily G-values of individual observers.
Columns: Year, Month, Day, G (as in the database), G corrected (mean), G corrected (low), G corrected (upper).

Concerning the question of Fig.4a, it is a correction matrix based solely on RGO  -- the matrix of the 'perfect'  observer (RGO) as a function of a 'pseudo-Wolf' (i.e., RGO with the applied Ss=45 msd threshold). You are right, it is not the real Wolf but pseudo-Wolf's data simulated with the RGO. Sorry for the confusing text, it should have been written more clear.
